# Warframe Lecta Tracker - Log Guide

This guide explains the data files generated by the tracker in your `OUTPUT` folder.

## 1. Master Run Log (`master_run_log.csv`)

This CSV file contains the raw data for your run. It is updated in real-time.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | Elapsed time in seconds since the run started (F8). |
| **Live** | *Requires Log Tracking.* Number of enemies currently alive on the map (from `EE.log`). |
| **Spawned** | *Requires Log Tracking.* Total number of enemies spawned since mission start (from `EE.log`). |
| **Credits** | Total credits accumulated. Updated when you press TAB. |
| **CPM** | **Credits Per Minute**. Calculated as `Credits / (Time / 60)`. |
| **Kills** | Total enemies killed. <br>• **Log Mode:** Calculated as `Spawned - Live`.<br>• **OCR Mode:** Read directly from the TAB menu. |
| **KPM** | **Kills Per Minute**. Calculated as `Kills / (Time / 60)`. |
| **FPS** | Frames Per Second (requires FPS Tracking). |
| **Event** | Markers for specific actions (e.g., "Scan" indicates a TAB press). |

## 2. Runtime Log (`runtime_log.txt`)

This text file records the internal events of the tracker.
*   **Location:** Inside the run folder. If **DEBUG MODE** is on, it is inside `DEBUG_INFO`.
*   **Format:** `[Date Time] [Run Timer] Message`

### Common Entries
*   **[Run]**: Indicates start/stop of the timer. Includes configuration details (Mode, Resolution, Active Features) at the start.
*   **[Scan]**: Details about OCR attempts when you press TAB.
    *   *Success:* `Scanned - Time: 1.50m | Credits: 150000 ...`
    *   *Failure:* `[Scan] FAIL: ...` followed by a **Hint** explaining what might be wrong (e.g., "Menu not open", "Boxes misaligned").
    *   *Retries:* Logs if OCR is retrying due to empty scans.
*   **[Tracker]**: Alerts for Acolyte spawns (`Triggering Acolyte Warner`) or Effigy status.
*   **[Controller]**: Logs button presses if you use a controller to trigger scans or stop warnings.
*   **[Debug]**: (If enabled) Logs EE.log offsets, file operations, and detailed error traces.

## 3. Debug Info (`DEBUG_INFO` Folder)

*Only created if **DEBUG MODE** is enabled in Settings.*

### Failed Scan Images
If a scan fails, the tracker saves the image it tried to read so you can adjust your bounding boxes.
*   **`NO_CREDITS_TEXT_AT_...png`**: The tracker could not find the word "Credits" in the Scan Area.
*   **`OCR_CREDITS_FAIL_AT_...png`**: The tracker found "Credits" but could not read the number.

### EE.log Recording
*   **`ee_recording.log`**: A safe copy of Warframe's `EE.log` covering **only** the duration of your run.
